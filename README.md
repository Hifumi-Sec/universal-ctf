## ðŸš© Welcome to a simpler way of getting started with CTFs!

CTF = Capture The Flag

Universal CTF is a project I started to help improve CTF experiences for beginners and speed up gathering results for veterans. Thanks to Universal CTF, you will no longer have to type out long commands over and over again, now you have a beautiful terminal-based program to handle it all for you!

## Example
```bash
python3 helper.py
```

## Installation
An install script has been provided to make sure you have everything installed. All you'll need to do is run the following commands to install everything you need.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/azazelm3dj3d/universal-ctf.git
```

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

```bash
./install.sh
```
